Textures

Now you can feel the sand between your toes. 

This took me about 6 hours. This was honestly harder than lighting. My textures kept glitching and I was convinced there were ghosts in my computer. 

But now there is a nice, yet admitedly a bit to firey, skybox. 

Also I litteraly just screen captured the individual parts of the skybox, thats why the edges aren't great.
