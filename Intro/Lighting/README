Lighting

To import the SDL2 audio library 
Linux: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
macOS: brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer
But I think we got that sorted last time

Enjoy the wonderful morning sunrise. 

This took me about 4.5 hours. 


The light is set to a sunrise position, but all the controlls for moving the light still work.

Also sorry the conrtolls for messing with the light settings are weird, I wanted to keep my WASD for movement
