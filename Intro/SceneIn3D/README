Scene in 3d: 3D Objects

The goal here was to make a nice peaceful beach scene. Good place for a tan... Once we get to lighting. 

This scene was built off example 8, showing how to render objects in 3d. 

This took me about 7 hours. 

Honestly I struggled more with the umbrellas than the waves. But thats just because by the time I got to the waves I was a Pro.
