Projections

To import the SDL2 audio library 
Linux: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
macOS: brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer

Let me know if the audio is breaking things and I'll be happy to resubmit without it. 

Enjoy a nice stroll on this peaceful beach. Let the calming wave sounds sooth your ailes

This scene was built off hw3. 

This took me about 2.5 hours.
